# Title

Task 1: Landing Page (Admission Portal)

## Description

The provided code implements a dashboard for an Admission Portal. The dashboard serves as a user interface for students to view and register for different courses offered by the institution. It consists of various sections, including a header, a carousel for course slides, a main section displaying course information, and a footer.

### Header
The header section is fixed at the top of the page and contains the navigation menu and user profile information. It includes a logo that serves as a link to the homepage, navigation links for "Home," "About," "Contact," and "Logout," and a user profile image. The header is responsive and adjusts its layout for mobile devices.

### Carousel
The carousel section displays a series of course slides. It allows users to navigate through different course offerings using previous and next buttons. Each slide represents a course and includes an image related to the course. The carousel automatically transitions between slides every two seconds.

### Main Section
The main section of the dashboard contains information about the available courses. It starts with a title and description explaining the purpose of course registration. Following that, there is a container that holds individual course cards.

Each course card represents a specific program and includes an image, a title, a description, and a "Register" button. The images provide visual representation of the courses, while the title and description provide brief information about each program. The "Register" button allows users to initiate the registration process for a particular course.

### Footer
The footer section appears at the bottom of the dashboard and displays copyright information. It includes a text indicating that all rights are reserved and provides a link to the GitHub profile of the repository owner.
